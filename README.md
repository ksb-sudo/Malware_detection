1.I have tried to compute whether there are any null values ,if present computed the percentage of null values present in the dataset.
2.Checked the type of variables present in the dataset ie integer type or object type.
3.I have chosen 15 attributes and tried to find the spearman correlation value between them and chosen the attributes which are positively correlated and has taken
value above 0.7  and took 4 attributes.
4.Also showed the heatmap of the attributes using seaborn library.
5.With the help of crosstab function,i tried to compute the percent of relation between the dependent variable ie legitimate and other 4 attributes.
